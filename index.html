        <p id="para2">There are only two triple centurions in Indian cricket history. The first one was Virender Sehwagâ€”he has done it twice. But who is the 
           other one? Even if you took a brief pause to answer this, the chances of your cricket fandom being questioned are slim. Such has been Karun Nair's career. The only 
           other Indian cricketer to score a Test triple century apart from Sehwag has been fighting an existential battle ever since that historical knock of 303* against 
           England in Chennai in 2016. Karun did not get an opportunity in the next Test despite that record triple century. In fact, he only played three Tests after that
           before being dropped from the squad entirely. It has been a constant struggle for him ever since.</p>
           <p id="para3">However, later in the evening Sudha Murty issued a clarification and wrote on X,"The story I shared on Raksha Bandhan is just one of many tales associated with 
              the festival and certainly not its origin. As I have said in the video clip, this was already a custom of the land. My intention was to highlight one of the 
              many stories I learnt about when growing up, about the beautiful symbolism behind Raksha Bandhan. Raksha Bandhan is a much older tradition that has transcended
              time and culture of our beloved country, one that I am proud of and look forward to with affection for my own siblings."</p>
